This repo contains all the scripts, scenes, prefabs, and images I used to make the game. It does contain the entire unity project.


A comment from the developer:

There are currently two main issues on this game. The first issue is that there is a bug where it displays the solution squares when you try and set the height and width too big messing with the board. The second issue is that it is unable to support possible two or more solutions on certain generated puzzles.

I have long shelved this project and I probably won't update it anymore. But if there was someone willing to polish it up then by all means do so. This was my first dive in game development and I'm glad with how it turned out. There are probably more game projects coming from me soon so do look forward to it.
